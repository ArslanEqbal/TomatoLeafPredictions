# TOMATO LEAF PREDICTIONS 
This is a python notebook file trained in Google Colab using transfer learning to detect the different classes of images . The state of art algorithm used is Inception_resnet_v2 to get an training accuracy of 85% and testing accuracy of 81%. Over 16,000 images are trained over different classes.

# BENEFITS
If you want to be more familiar with Computer Vision Projects , then these projects are made for you and you can clone and apply it in your own local machine and try using different types of state of art algorithms for more knowledge.
